# Earnings-Manipulation-Detection

The paper investigates a large number of earnings manipulators and aims to examine their distinguishing characteristics. To achieve this, accounting line items of manipulators’ and non-manipulators’ financial statements has been analyzed and logistic regressions were used to develop models, which are able to predict if a firm is manipulating its financials. The regressors of the model have been created in such a way they may capture the effect of manipulation or some preconditions that induce the firm to engage in earnings management or accounting fraud. Moreover, the regressors employed in the paper were mentioned in previous research on this topic (Beneish, 1999; Dechow, 2011). The results of my models suggest that there is a relationship between accounting ratios and probability of manipulation.
Since earnings manipulation constitutes a problem, not only for auditors, but also for investors and other market participants, these models may be used to identify most of the companies involved in earnings manipulation before public discovery. Even though these models can be easily implemented, a firm may be individuated as a manipulator due to possible distortions in its financial statements, also if it has not altered its financials.
